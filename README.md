# IntroductionToRobotics

Laboratory assignments for the Robotics Introduction Course, completed during the third year of study at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Each assignment has got included the instructions we had to follow, implementation guidelines, code samples, and also is accompanied by image files.


# Homework-1 
<h1>RGB</h1>
<details>
<p><b>Assignment details</b></p> 
This assignment focuses on controlling each channel (Red, Green, and Blue) of  an  RGB  LED  using  individual  potentiometers.   By  the  end  of  this  task, we  will  gain  experience  in  interfacing  potentiometers  with  the  Arduino  and controlling RGB LEDs based on the analog readings. <br>
The main components we will use specifically for this task are an RGB led, 3 potentiometers, resistors and as many wires as needed. <br>
The scope is to use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED: Red, Green, and Blue and this control must leverage digital electronics. <br>
In essence, we will need to read the potentiometerâ€™s value with the Arduino board and then write a mapped value to the LED pins.
